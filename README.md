## Set up a development environment with the Python framework and database you have chosen. This might involve installing the necessary software and libraries, as well as creating a new project or application.
1.- Set git project with python .gitignore
2.- Install python 3.11.1
3.- Install visual studio code
4.- Create virtual environment: "python -m venv venv"
5.- Install fastAPI: "pip install fastapi[all]"
6.- Create main.py to set up fastAPI main class.
7.- Set initial skeleton.

## Design the data models and database schema to support relationships between users, such as friends. This might involve creating classes or tables to represent the users and their relationships using SQLAlchemy/SQLModel, Django ORM or any other ORM/query builder of your choice. Please also consider the relationships between the data models and how they will be stored in the database.

1.- Install Postgresql 15.1 and set database schema with pgAdmin
2.- Install sqlalchemy: "pip install sqlalchemy" and set entity with SQLAlchemy ORM.
3.- Install alembic for database migrations
## Implement the API endpoints and their corresponding functions to manage these relationships. This might include endpoints for retrieving a list of friends for a user, as well as endpoints for adding or removing friends. Handle errors and exceptions that may occur during API requests, such as if a user tries to add a friend that does not exist.
